# TODO APP

LIVE Deployment: https://todo-app-f2o1.onrender.com/

Platform used: render.com

### Key Notes

- FE served on root route `/`

- Refer to this [blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-nodejs-application-with-render/) to deploy a Node JS application on render.com

- Use dynamic API Endpoints instead of localhost in Frontend while calling APIs

- You can do that with `window.location.origin` which gives back the url until route which is all you need when your APIs are available relatively from origin.

Created a new branch `todo-app` from Week-2-Assignments fork which includes code for both FE and BE.
